# Stock_Market_Portfolio_Optimization
This project maximizes the Sharpe Ratio by optimizing a stock portfolio using Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT). It examines the historical data of four stocks (HDFCBANK.NS, INFY.NS, RELIANCE.NS, and TCS.NS), computes returns and volatility, and simulates portfolios to determine the best risk-reward balance.
