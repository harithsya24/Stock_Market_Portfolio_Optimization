# Stock Portfolio Optimization

## Overview

This project applies Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) to optimize a stock portfolio by balancing risk and return. It uses historical stock data to simulate various portfolio combinations and finds the one with the highest Sharpe Ratio, indicating optimal risk-adjusted returns.

## Features

*Portfolio Optimization:* Finds the optimal portfolio with the highest Sharpe Ratio by adjusting weights for each stock.
*Monte Carlo Simulation:* Simulates 10,000 different portfolio combinations to identify the most efficient one.
*Stock Data Processing:* Calculates expected returns and volatility from historical stock prices.
*Visualization:* Plots results of portfolio simulations, including risk-return graphs and efficient frontier.
